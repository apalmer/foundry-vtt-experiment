This attack uses the statistics for their signature attack, except the fire is a ranged weapon with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 60 feet. On a hit, the attack deals an extra PB damage, and all the damage dealt by the attack is fire damage instead of slashing damage.\n\n3rd Level: Roll Out (5 Ferocity). The drangolin moves up to their walking speed in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. The drangolin can end this movement in a space that contains another creature. If they do, that creature takes 2 x PB bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the drangolin traveled, and they must make a DC 10 plus PB Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 5 feet out of the drangolin\u0027s space into an unoccupied space of the creature\u0027s choice.\n\n5th Level: Rend and Roast (8 Ferocity). The drangolin makes two signature attacks against the same target, then breathes fire on them.

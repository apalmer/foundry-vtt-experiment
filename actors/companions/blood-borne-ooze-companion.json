On a hit, the attack deals its normal effects, and the next attack made against the target before the start of the ooze\u0027s next turn has advantage.\n\n3rd Level: Clever Goop (5 Ferocity). The ooze takes the Hide action and makes a signature attack (in either order). If the attack hits a Large or smaller creature, the target is knocked prone. While the ooze is hidden in this way, they can approach a creature or move where they\u0027re clearly visible without automatically giving away their position.\n\n5th Level: Crimson Feast (8 Ferocity). The ooze attempts to enter the body of a creature they can see within 5 feet of them who isn\u0027t a Construct or an Undead. The target must make a DC 10 plus PB Constitution saving throw.
